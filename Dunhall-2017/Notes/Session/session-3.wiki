== Gameplay Notes ==

Abdin and Faena tried to talk to the goblin captive. Abdin failed miserably to talk him into anything, so Faeana had to intimidate the shit out of him. They were making sacrificed to Mortarian (the god who created the goblins). He is afraid of the cleric (their leader). They were headed to an ancient castle.

The castle was Caer Dowl, a castle deep in the woods used in the halarian/gobin war 300 years ago. This has now been overtaken by the Wouldin Wood. The castle is to the North.

Abdin spent 15 gp on maniacal, and 20 gp on the lock.

Leaving the town the next day, the party ran across a suspicious leprechaun, Idwal Mac. He invited us to a summer solstice celebration. The party suspects that he is up to no good (but perhaps) not malice. When asked about Deliala, he knew of her. The fae folks had not manged to do anything for her. We said we might seem him at the party in the woods.

Finding the castle, we found it in a state of rushed repair.

Feana magically manipulated out Goblin captive to tell us how to break into the castle. Leaving him behind, we went down river to cross at a safe spot. After soaking Abdin, Faena and Mateo, we snuck to the castle. Sending in Nuwkul into the castle to light a fire, we used the distraction to sneek in and find the priest.

Sneaking into the abomination of the church, we got the jump on the guards and priest. Finishing them off without issue, we found ourselves trapped. Burning the alter, with the body of the priest attached, we use the sight to scare off the remaining vile beasts. Recovering from the battle, we were suprised to find two gnoles leaving the keep. One fell to it's death, the other took off like a bat out of hell.

Leaving the castle, we visited the glade with the party of Fae creatures. Feana was caught in her lie, although Delialia did not seem to catch onto this fact. Feana talked to her, and learned of the tale of Bran the Third. He apprently was an ancient hero that ganed fame in defeating a group of sea monsters. He went to the underkeep to acquire a collection of wishing stones. She wants us to go there to get them, and help break her curse.
