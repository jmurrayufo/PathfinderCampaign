== Events ==

We return to sweet water before making our way back home. While the plateau was preparing for the celebrations. 

Our (Matteo and I)'s grandmother's amulet has been stolen. We have been asked to retrieve it discreetly. 

Leana (my twin sister) met us at the party, and gave us some more detail about the amulet. She was extremely upset about the events leading to the theft.We arranged to meet at the gazebo later in the evening. 

Briar noticed that Baron Elario Forelli acted strangly when told about the Gnolls back at the castle. He suspects that he is somewhat award of what is going on with them. Abden suggested questing him, but was talked out of it. 
 
The amulet is a very powerful atifact, suspected to be granted to our people to 'bring prosperity' to Dunhall. Leana is to take the amulet, when she becomes queen (or ruler? w/e). 

She shared with us that my grandfather is to pass away in 60 days (the day AFTER his 60's birthday). This was part of a prophecy that has helped him lead for many years (thus we believe it). 

Searching the tomb, we found that many graves were robbed, not just the one with the amulet. The robber clearly had a limp, probably from a bad leg. Briar things this was from a thief of middling intelligence. 

Searching in (TOWN NAME?), we found that Grandpa Stan was sold the amulet about a month ago
